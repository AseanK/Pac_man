# Pac- Man
In this project, I made the famouse game, Pac_man. I made it to move in both in directions, with open and closed mouth. When it hits the edge of the screen, it flips and moves to the other direction.

## How to run
To run this program, you have to click on the pac-man.

## Things to improve in future
I'd like to make the pac-man to move to the users' input direction.
